## The monkey is made out of ascii characters if you could not tell

here are some monkey facts:

+ the monkey is made of ascii characters
+ the american standard code for information interchange was created specifically to display this monkey
+ i told a fib there
+ it wasnt really made to display this monkey

[here](https://www.asciiart.eu/animals/monkeys) is where i got the monkey from.
