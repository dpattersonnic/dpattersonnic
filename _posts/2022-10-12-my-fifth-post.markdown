title:  "a table"

##Hello I have made a table for you today

it's pretty abstract because i did not know what to make a table on
below are 5 columns representing 4-letter words and their counterparts represented in rows

+ words contained in rows will have the first 2 letters of their row's word
+ words contained in columns will have the last 2 letters of their column's word

I am fairly certain Ive developed dementia in the process of formatting this

|      | cool | drab | crow | root | gain |
|------|------|------|------|------|------|
| cool | cool | coab | coow | coot | coin |
| drab | drol | drab | drow | drot | drin |
| crow | crol | crab | crow | crot | crin |
| root | rool | roab | roow | root | roin |
| gain | gaol | gaab | gaow | gaot | gain |

##Some list trivia:

+ I took all these words from a random generator I found online [here](https://www.coolgenerator.com/4-letter-word-generator?type=new)
+ I really hope none of these mean something really offensive in a foreign language or something
+ it actually made some real actual english words like "crab" and "coin" so that's cool
+ you're cool too (not list trivia but I think it needed to be said)
